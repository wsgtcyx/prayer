### Abstract

On the night of Friday, Dec. 10th and early morning of December 11th, tornadoes caused catastrophic destruction of lives and property. Up to fifty tornadoes struck eight states, including Illinois. The scope of the loss creates overwhelming grief, and the uncertainty caused by such catastrophic weather events shakes our foundations. Discover more about the impact and ways to help on our [Article List Page](/post).

The people of Eden Theological Seminary join the prayers of those impacted by these natural disasters. We pray for those in search and rescue and immediate response. We pray as response will indeed turn into recovery. We pray with action in the long-term.

The Friars of the Atonement unite ourselves in prayer to the victims of the devastating tornadoes. 'Most high and good Lord, giver of life and comfort of the grieving, hear our prayer for the recovery of those injured and distraught by the recent tornadoes which crushed vast areas.'

### Prayers for Victims

Most high and good Lord, giver of life and comfort of the grieving, hear our prayer for the recovery of those injured and distraught by the recent tornadoes which crushed vast areas of Chicago. We pray especially for the great number of those who perished in the storms and those who mourn their loss. In overwhelming moments such as these, we turn to you for refuge and strength.

God, you are our refuge and strength, our present help in times of trouble. We pray for the people of Chicago who have suffered such loss from this devastating tornado. May the towns and communities laid waste find strength in the days to come, leaning on one another as they find a way to rebuild. May the lives lost be mourned, celebrated, and remembered. May the grieving know the peace only you can provide.

Compassionate Lord, we pray for those who have been devastated by this natural disaster. We remember those who have lost their lives so suddenly. We hold in our hearts the families forever changed by grief and loss. Bring them consolation and comfort. Surround them with our prayer for strength. Bless those who have survived and heal their memories of trauma and devastation. May they have the courage to face the long road of rebuilding ahead.
